Cyber-Duck Tech Test
===================

A simple website built with responsiveness in mind, based on .psd files provided for phones, tablets and desktop screens. I used [Simple-Grid](https://github.com/ThisIsDallas/Simple-Grid) as a very minimal package for grid layouts.

This was a really enjoyable challenge as it covered many aspects of front-end development including sprites, CSS-animations, media queries and working with Photoshop/Illustrator. I spent roughly 8/9 hours on this task and would liked to have finished the responsiveness of the social icon footer if I had more time.

Specifications
-------------
### First stage
In the first stage, the following is expected to be completed:
- Desktop layout
- Main menu links must show `:hover` and `.current` styles
- Markup should be standard valid code
- Prepare the markup for responsive layouts

### Second stage
The second stage will be starting from first stage's code and it should try to complete the following tasks:
- Responsive layouts (following designs provided)
- Use of sprites
- Addition of jQuery/JS
- CSS animations

### Other considerations
- All markup must be done manually
- Do not use CSS reset
- Do not use IDs in the CSS (`#selector`)
- The use of plugins and/or gird system is allowed (not the use of a complete CSS framework)
- Knowledge of Sass is valuable
- Font is PT Sans, can be used with Google Fonts service
